			FIRST OF ALL
this code uses many parts of ruby socket source code
and some from bluez/tools/hcitool.c so many thanks to
everybody that work on those, in any case thanks to all
open source community.

-------------------------------------------------------
This is a porting of the Bluez library to Ruby,
right now are just few functions and i hope in future 
to bring them all!

HCI actual functions
	hci_get_route
	hci_open_dev
	hci_inquiry
	hci_read_local_name
	hci_write_local_name
	hci_devba
	hci_read_class_of_dev
	hci_write_class_of_dev
	hci_read_remote_name
	hci_create_connection
	hci_read_remote_version
	hci_disconnect

Socket to Rfcomm
	socket
	bind
	listen
	connect
	accept
	recv

Rfcomm functions are regular Socket function but 
rfcomm oriented
